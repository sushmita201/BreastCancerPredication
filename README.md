# Breast Cancer Predication Using Machine Learning with python
## 1.Problem definition 
Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant
## 2.Data
For furthur reference u can see the data sets which I took from KAGGLE https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data

This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:
ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu
cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/

Also can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
## 4. Data dictionary details

### Attribute Information:

* ID number
* Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter
* area
* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
* compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry
* fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
